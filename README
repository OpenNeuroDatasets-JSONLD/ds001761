### General: 
4 participants participated in 8 (f)MRI sessions. Each of these 8 sessions consisted of between 11 and 14 runs.

### The data folder for each participant is organized as follows:

* sub/ses/anat: contains the T1 anatomical scans (defaced) for this session. Most anat folders contain one T1.nii.gz file. However, when a subject was taken out of the scanner and re-positioned during a session, a second T1 scan was performed. As a result the anat folder for this session will contain two T1.nii.gz files.

 

* sub/ses/func/: contains the *_bold.nii.gz and *-events.tsv files for each experimental run. Two types of tasks were performed:
