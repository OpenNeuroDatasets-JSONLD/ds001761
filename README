# Reconstructing Faces from fMRI Patterns using Deep Generative Neural Networks

Data folder related to the paper: ["Reconstructing Faces from fMRI Patterns using Deep Generative Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03856) by VanRullen &amp; Reddy (2019)

### General: 
4 participants participated in 8 (f)MRI sessions. Each of these 8 sessions consisted of between 11 and 13 runs.

##The data folder for each participant is organized as follows:


### This folder contains:
* a pre-trained VAE-GAN model checkpoint 'vaegan_celeba.ckpt' (~15 epochs on CelebA dataset=50,000 batches of 64 images)
* a set of .py functions for the VAE-GAN face decomposition/reconstruction model, in particular:
  * VAEGAN_image2latent.py => goes from any image file to the corresponding 1024D latent encoding (saved as a Matlab .mat file)
  * VAEGAN_latent2image.py => goes from a 1024D latent encoding (Matlab .mat file) to the corresponding image(s)
* (optional) [a link to download the fMRI datasets](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001759) (4 subjects, each saw > 8,000 faces in the scanner) and some Matlab analysis code
